      <h3>Ancient Kingdoms – Before 1200 AD</h3>
      <p>
        Ghana's roots trace back to powerful kingdoms like the Ghana Empire (not in modern Ghana),
        followed by the rise of the Ashanti and Mole-Dagbani kingdoms. These civilizations were
        known for their trade in gold, kola nuts, and culture.

      <h3>Arrival of Europeans – 15th Century</h3>
      <p>
        Portuguese explorers arrived in 1471, building Elmina Castle in 1482. Ghana became central in
        the trans-Atlantic trade routes for gold, spices, and, sadly, enslaved people.

      <h3>Colonial Rule – 1800s</h3>
      <p>
        The British formally colonized the Gold Coast in the late 1800s. During this time,
        resistance from the Ashanti people became a symbol of defiance and strength.

      <h3>Independence – 1957</h3>
      <p>
        Ghana became the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence from colonial rule
        on March 6, 1957, led by Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. It became a beacon of Pan-Africanism.
